StockAlret
==========

A open source application where you can set a alert to your target value of stock. Also comes with a real time chart.

You need to do a npm install and you are ready to go.
You can directly run the app.js using node.

P.S : you have to search with NSE listed company names with their NSE listed names.
You also have to enter an amount where you want the alert to come.

I have used Highcharts for charting and it's open source for open source use purpose.
